# Keploy MF

To reproduce (on `ghcr.io/keploy/keploy:v2.3.0-beta38`):

1. `cd symfony`
2. `make install`
3. `make clean`
4. change in the config the first target container `containerName: "php-book-sf"` to record mocks at init
5. `keploy start`
6. Open another tab or shell
7. `make init-db` to play migrations of the BDD to init it
8. Look at the folder keploy and see the mock
9. Try a curl like : 

    ```shell
    curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8000/employee' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
        "firstName": "Myke",
        "lastName": "Tyson",
        "email": "mt2@gmail.com",
        "timestamp":1
    }'
    ```
    Logs are good : `php-book-sf       | 172.21.0.2 -  13/Nov/2024:06:26:08 +0000 "POST /index.php" 200`

    And nothing appear in the test folder of keploy...because I target nginx and not php directly ? Because the load balancing of nginx to PHP is not record...

10. switch the config with `containerName: "nginx-book-sf"` to record mocks at init
11. stop keploy and run again `keploy record`
12. Try a curl like :

    ```shell
    curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8000/employee' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
        "firstName": "Myke",
        "lastName": "Tyson",
        "email": "mt2@gmail.com",
        "timestamp":1
    }'
    ```

13. Look at the folder keploy and see the tests created but no mocks


Is it possible to record many conntainer ? A full network ?
